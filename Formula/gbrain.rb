  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      This is upstream's self-contained binary. gbrain keeps its own update
      channel: `gbrain upgrade` replaces the binary in this Homebrew keg in
      place, and the tap's scheduled workflow keeps the formula pinned to the
      latest upstream release, so `brew upgrade gbrain` tracks upstream too.
      In-place self-update needs a user-writable Homebrew prefix.

      Upstream publishes binaries for macOS arm64 and Linux x86_64 only.

      This is not the unrelated npm `gbrain` package. Start a brain with:

        gbrain init --pglite
        gbrain doctor
